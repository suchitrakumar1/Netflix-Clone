🎬 Netflix Clone
<br>
A fully responsive clone of the Netflix landing page built using HTML & CSS.
This project focuses on recreating the visual layout, structure, and styling of Netflix while ensuring smooth responsiveness across devices.

✨ About the Project<br>
I recreated the core Netflix homepage experience including the hero section, navigation bar, and content-style sections.
The main goal was to practice responsive design, layout structuring, and UI accuracy using only core web technologies.
The layout adapts from desktop screens down to 370 px mobile width without breaking alignment or spacing.
